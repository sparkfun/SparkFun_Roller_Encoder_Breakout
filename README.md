[*SparkFun Roller Encoder Breakout (PCB-29094)*](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/29094)

A simple breakout board for the EVQWGD001 roller wheel encoder by Panasonic. It is similar to what you might find on a steering wheel or other circa 2000s automotive input. While the EVQWGD001 is not manufactured anymore, it's an often sought after user input because of its feel and unique input mode.
